# The Scrum (Summary)

## 1. Purpose
Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

## 2. Definition
Consists:
1. Scrum Team;
2. Roles;
3. Events;
4. Artifacts;
5. Rules.

## 3. Uses    
Initially developed for managing and developing products, and has been used extensively to:

1. Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and products capabilities;
2. Develop products and enhancements;
3. Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
4. Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and otheroperational environments for product use; and,
5. Sustain and renew products.

Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer.

The essence of  Scrum is a small team of people.

## 4. Theory
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:

1. **Transparency**:
    Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
        
    For example:
    * A common language refering to the process must be shared by all participants; and,
    * Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a common definition of "Done".
    
    
2. **Inspection**:
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection get in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligntly performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.

3. **Adaptation**:
If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviction.

## 5. Values
1. Commitment;
2. Courage;
3. Focus;
4. Openness;
5. Respect.

When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparecy, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum roles, events, and artifacts. 

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values.

## 6. The Scrum Team

 Consists:
 1. Product Owner;
 2. Development Team;
 3. Scrum Master.
